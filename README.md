Takes webcam footage and converts it into a gif made of emojis.

Each block of pixels in the webcam image is replaced with the nearest emoji, based on the average color of pixels in each block.

Uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for the webcam and graphics, and [gif.js](https://github.com/jnordberg/gif.js) for turning the canvas into a gif.
